Notes React Application
===================================

Overview
--------
Notes React is a simple react web app I created when I first started learning react, its allows users to create, delete, and view notes. Built with React and utilizing Material-UI and JSON Server libraries, this application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing personal or professional notes efficiently.

Features
--------
- Create Notes: Users can easily create new notes by entering a title and content. The application provides a form for capturing the note details.
- Delete Notes: Users have the option to delete unwanted notes. Each note is accompanied by a delete button, which, when clicked, removes the note from the list.
- View Notes: The application displays a list of all the created notes. Users can view the title and content of each note for reference.

Dependencies
------------
The Notes React Application utilizes the following dependencies:

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Material-UI: React UI component library for creating visually appealing and responsive interfaces.
- JSON Server: Library for simulating a RESTful API by serving data from a JSON file.
